# Book & Author Management Web Application

## Overview
This project is a web application for managing books and authors. Users can add, edit, delete, and view books and authors. The application offers features for:

- **Book Management** (title, ISBN, category, year of publication, author(s), etc.)
- **Author Management** (name, list of books)
- **Assigning authors to books** and viewing books by author

---

## Implementation Details

### ‚úîÔ∏è Domain Layer (JPA, Hibernate, ManyToMany)
- The application uses JPA and Hibernate for database management.
- There are `Book` and `Author` entities annotated with `@Entity`.
- A `@ManyToMany` relationship between books and authors is implemented.
- Repository interfaces (`BookRepository`, `AuthorRepository`) use Spring Data JPA.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Business Logic Layer
- DTO classes (`BookDTO`, `AuthorDTO`) are used for communication between the client and server.
- Service interfaces (`BookService`, `AuthorService`) and their implementations (`BookServiceImpl`, `AuthorServiceImpl`) handle business logic.
- Services provide methods for adding, updating, deleting, and assigning authors to books.
- Input validation is implemented (e.g., `@NotBlank(message = "Title is required")` in `BookDTO`).

### üõ°Ô∏è Exception Handling
- Custom exception classes and global exception handlers have been added to improve error management.
- Proper HTTP status codes are returned for different error scenarios, such as not found, bad request, or internal server errors.
- Example: If a book or author is not found, the API responds with a clear message and proper status code (`404 Not Found`).

### ‚úîÔ∏è API Layer (REST API, Endpoints, Swagger)
- REST controllers (`BookController`, `AuthorController`) manage API endpoints:
  - `/books` ‚Äî CRUD operations for books
  - `/books/{isbn}/authors` ‚Äî assign authors to a book
  - `/authors` ‚Äî CRUD operations for authors
  - `/authors/{id}/books` ‚Äî list books for a given author
- Utilizes `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, and standard RESTful practices.
- API documentation is provided with Swagger (OpenAPI).

### üöÄ Swagger Documentation & Endpoints
The API is documented using Swagger, which provides an interactive UI to explore and test endpoints:

- **Getting Started**: Accessible via `/swagger-ui.html` (or the configured Swagger URL).
- **Available Endpoints** include:
  - `POST /books` ‚Äî Create a new book
  - `GET /books/{isbn}` ‚Äî Retrieve book details
  - `PUT /books/{isbn}` ‚Äî Update book details
  - `DELETE /books/{isbn}` ‚Äî Delete a book
  - `POST /books/{isbn}/authors` ‚Äî Assign authors to a book
  - `GET /authors` ‚Äî List all authors
  - `GET /authors/{id}/books` ‚Äî List books by an author
  - `POST /authors` ‚Äî Add a new author
  - `PUT /authors/{id}` ‚Äî Update author info
  - `DELETE /authors/{id}` ‚Äî Delete an author

Enjoy seamless interaction with the API through the Swagger UI, which also displays detailed request and response schemas.
